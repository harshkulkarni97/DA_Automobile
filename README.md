# Analyzing Manufacturing and Inventory Data

This project focuses on streamlining the manufacturing and inventory operations of an automobile company by transforming large-scale datasets into actionable insights. The objective was to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource utilization, and support data-driven decision-making through analytics and visualization.

---

## Project Overview

The project involved end-to-end data handlingâ€”from raw data preprocessing to dashboard visualization. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, large volumes of manufacturing data were cleaned, modeled, and analyzed to identify performance trends, inefficiencies, and cost-saving opportunities.

## Tools and Technologies

- *Python:* Data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation  
- *SQL:* Database querying, joins, and data extraction  
- *Power BI:* Interactive dashboard creation and KPI tracking  

---

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

Raw manufacturing and inventory data were processed to ensure accuracy and consistency:

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Created calculated fields such as total production cost and production yield  
- Standardized data types and formats for seamless analysis  

SQL queries were designed to join, filter, and aggregate data efficiently for downstream processing and visualization.

## Data Modeling

A star schema data model was implemented to optimize performance and reduce redundancy.

*Model Design:*
- *Fact Table:* Key metrics including production volume, inventory cost, and defect rate  
- *Dimension Tables:* Product type, manufacturing line, supplier, and date information  

This structure improved query performance and enabled smooth integration with Power BI dashboards.

## Dashboard Development

Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to provide real-time insights into production and inventory operations.

*Key Features:*
- Custom KPIs such as production yield, downtime per line, and inventory turnover  
- Trend analysis using line and bar charts for production and cost metrics  
- Heatmaps highlighting inefficiencies and bottlenecks  
- Dynamic filters by product type, location, and time frame  

These dashboards allowed managers to monitor performance and make informed operational decisions.

## Key Insights and Outcomes

The analysis led to several measurable improvements:

- *Inventory Optimization:* Identified overstocked components, reducing holding costs.  
- *Production Efficiency:* Analyzed downtime data to prioritize maintenance activities.  
- *Resource Allocation:* Supported better scheduling and distribution of resources.  

---

## Results

- Reduced excess inventory and operational costs  
- Improved data refresh speeds and dashboard performance  
- Enhanced visibility into production and inventory metrics  

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of predictive analytics for machine downtime forecasting  
- Automation of data pipelines using Python and SQL  
- Inclusion of supplier performance and quality metrics in dashboards
